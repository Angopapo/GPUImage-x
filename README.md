Idea from: [iOS GPUImage framework](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage) and [Android GPUImage framework](https://github.com/CyberAgent/android-gpuimage)

The GPUImage-x framework is cross-platform (for both Android and iOS) library, which aims to have something similar to GPUImage that let you apply GPU-accelerated filters to images, live camera video. The greatest strength of that libray is that it enables you maintain your Android and iOS project with one library, as core code of library is written in C++.
